## ü§î Why should I block League of Legends?
League of Legends (LoL) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games.
However, it has gained a reputation for having a toxic community characterized by verbally abusive, hostile, or insulting behavior towards other players.
This toxic behavior can have a negative impact on players' mental health and well-being, causing anxiety, depression, and other negative consequences.
It can also decrease players' self-confidence and self-esteem, making it harder for them to enjoy the game and perform well.

Toxic behavior in LoL can extend beyond the game itself, leading to negative attitudes towards the gaming community as a whole.
Thus, it's important to recognize the importance of mental health and well-being in the gaming community and take steps to reduce toxic behavior and create a more welcoming and inclusive gaming environment.

In addition to blocking LoL in Pi-hole, players can take other measures to protect their mental health while playing.
These include muting or blocking toxic players, reporting them to game moderators, and seeking support from friends and loved ones.
It's also crucial for players to practice self-care by taking breaks from the game, engaging in other activities they enjoy, and seeking professional help if necessary.

One effective way to mitigate the impact of LoL's toxic community is by blocking the game in Pi-hole.
This is a simple process that involves setting up a Pi-hole server on the network and adding LoL to the blocklist.
By doing so, players can avoid being exposed to toxic behavior from other players and protect their mental health and well-being.

In conclusion, while LoL can be an entertaining game, its toxic community can have negative consequences.
By taking steps to reduce toxic behavior and blocking the game in Pi-hole, players can create a more enjoyable and inclusive gaming experience while protecting their mental health and well-being.

## üß† How to Protect Your Mental Health in LoL
> Dealing with toxicity and aggression.

To start with, it's crucial to understand that toxic behavior in the game isn't your fault.
No matter how well, or poorly you perform, other players should never harass or belittle you.
If you come across aggressive behavior, it's best to keep calm and refrain from getting into a flame war or responding with negative remarks. This can only worsen the situation.

Instead, consider muting or blocking the player who's being aggressive towards you.
This way, you'll avoid their toxic behavior and stay focused on the game.
If possible, you may also report their behavior to the game moderators or support team, providing evidence.

Another effective way to handle aggression is to surround yourself with positive and supportive players.
Joining a team or finding like-minded players can create a sense of community and help you avoid toxic players.
Additionally, you can seek support from your friends or family members to process your feelings and cope with any negative emotions that may arise from toxic behavior.

Lastly, it's vital to prioritize your mental health and well-being while playing League of Legends.
Taking breaks from the game, practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques, and engaging in other enjoyable activities can help you maintain a positive outlook and prevent negative emotions from building up.

In summary, dealing with aggression in League of Legends entails staying calm, muting or blocking aggressive players, reporting their behavior, surrounding yourself with positive players, and prioritizing your mental health and well-being.
By following these steps, you can protect yourself from toxic behavior and enjoy the game in a safe and welcoming environment.

## ü§î Why should I block Valorant?
Valorant is a first-person shooter game developed by Riot Games that was released in 2020.
It has gained a large following and become a significant part of the esports scene.
However, some users may want to block Valorant on their [Pi-hole](./What%20is%20Pi-hole.md) for various reasons.
In this response, we will discuss what Valorant is, why people may want to block it, and how to block it in Pi-hole.

Valorant is a free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooter game that is similar to games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.
The game is set in a near-future world where agents with unique abilities battle it out in 5v5 matches.
The game has a heavy focus on tactics and strategy, and each agent has their unique abilities, making it crucial to build a team that can complement each other's strengths and weaknesses.

One of the main reasons why some people may choose to block Valorant is because of its anti-cheat software called Vanguard.
This software runs in the background while you play the game and has full kernel-level access to your computer, which means it can monitor everything you do on your device.
While the software is designed to prevent cheating, some users have raised concerns about its intrusive nature and the potential for it to be used for malicious purposes.
Therefore, blocking Valorant can help ensure that Vanguard does not have access to your computer.

Another reason why some people may choose to block Valorant is because of its connection to Riot Games, which is owned by Tencent, a Chinese company with a controversial track record when it comes to user privacy and data security.
While there is no evidence to suggest that Riot Games or Valorant are engaging in any malicious activities, some people may still be concerned about the potential for their data to be compromised.
Therefore, blocking Valorant can help ensure that your personal information is not being shared with Tencent or any other third-party entities.

Additionally, blocking Valorant can help improve your overall online security and privacy.
By using a tool like Pi-hole to block the game, you can prevent Valorant from communicating with its servers and potentially exposing your IP address or other sensitive information.
This can help protect you from potential cyberattacks and other security threats.

In conclusion, while Valorant is a popular game with many positive aspects, there are also some concerns about its security and privacy.
Therefore, some people may choose to block it using a tool like Pi-hole to ensure that their personal information is not being compromised and their overall online security is improved.

## ü§î Why should I block Valorant?
Riot Games is a beloved game developer responsible for the creation of popular games like League of Legends (LoL), Valorant, and Teamfight Tactics.
These games boast millions of players worldwide and offer plenty of fun and entertainment.

However, if you're concerned about your online privacy, you might want to consider using Pi-hole to block Riot Games.
The company has a history of collecting player data, including IP addresses, location, and online behavior, which some players may find discomforting.
Although Riot Games claims they use this data to enhance player experience, blocking their access to your data through Pi-hole is an easy way to protect your privacy.

Another reason to block Riot Games with Pi-hole is to avoid their toxic player communities.
Although they've implemented measures to address harassment and other negative behaviors, they still exist to some extent.
By blocking Riot Games, you can choose to steer clear of these communities entirely and have a more positive online experience.

Finally, using Pi-hole to block Riot Games can help curb distractions and time-wasting activities.
Video games can be addictive, and many players find themselves losing track of time while immersed in gameplay.
By removing the temptation to play these games, you can focus on more productive activities and take control of your online experience.

In summary, Riot Games and their games are fantastic sources of entertainment, but if you're looking to safeguard your online privacy, avoid toxic communities, or reduce time spent gaming, using Pi-hole to block Riot Games is a wise choice.
With Pi-hole, you can control your online experience and only engage with content that aligns with your values and priorities.

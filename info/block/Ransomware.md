## üò£ Ransomware Domains
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key.
These attacks can have devastating consequences, as the victim's files may be lost forever if the ransom is not paid.
One effective way to protect against ransomware attacks is to block known domains associated with ransomware.

Please note that the list of URLs provided below is not comprehensive but can serve as a reference for blocking ransomware domains in Pi-hole.
Blocking these URLs can improve online safety and reduce potential risks. It is also recommended to consider additional measures to enhance online safety.

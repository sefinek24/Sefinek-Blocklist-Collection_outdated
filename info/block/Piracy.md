## üîí What are Piracy Domains?
Piracy domains are websites, servers, and services that are used to distribute copyrighted content such as movies, music, books, and computer games without permission from the copyright holders.
Accessing and downloading such content from these domains is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why are piracy domains a security threat?
In addition to the legal implications, piracy domains can also pose a major security threat.
Many of these domains host malware, phishing scams, and other malicious content that can harm your devices and compromise your personal information.
Visiting piracy domains can also increase the risk of getting infected with viruses and other malware, which can cause your devices to slow down, crash, or become unstable.

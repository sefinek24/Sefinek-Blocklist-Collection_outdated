## üïπÔ∏è Gambling Domains
Gambling domains refer to websites that offer online gambling services, such as sports betting, casino games, and poker.
These websites are known to be associated with addictive behavior and can lead to financial problems for those who become addicted to gambling.
To protect yourself or others from these negative consequences, it is necessary to block access to gambling domains.
One way to do this is by using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network.

You can add a list of gambling domains to Pi-hole to prevent users on your network from accessing these websites and potentially developing gambling addictions.

The following are some sample URLs with a list of domains:
- https://cdn.sefinek.net/resources/PiHole-Blocklist-Collection/blocklist/gambling.txt
- https://blocklistproject.github.io/Lists/gambling.txt
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MajkiIT/polish-ads-filter/master/polish-pihole-filters/gambling-hosts.txt

Please note that this list of URLs is not comprehensive and there may be other domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks.
Therefore, consider using this list as a reference and explore other measures to further enhance online safety.

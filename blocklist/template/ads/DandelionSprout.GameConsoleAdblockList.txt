# Blocks the "Theme Shop", with the intention of preventing the annoying pink dot in the upper left of the Home Menu from reappearing all the time.
# The entry is known to block Animal Crossing Home Designer's "Special design requests" system, although that system has been inactive since 2017.
# WARNING: The "Theme Shop" should be visited once to remove the pink dot, and only then should this list be subscribed to.

# There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings → System → News Channel Settings → Nintendo News → Unfollow.
# The following entries gives access on demand to the web browser, as per SwitchBru's DNS server trick (https://www.switchbru.com/dns), while also making it possible to use AdGuard Home for adblocking at the same time. However, since SwitchBru uses a trick to make the Switch think it's partway into logging on to a hotel network, the entries would reject access to all other Switch web activities while the entries are live:

# I am not personally aware of any Free McBoot homebrew apps that can connect to external domains, let alone unintentionally.
# There are multiple third-party online game servers for the PS2, most of them with flimsy websites and uptime. Popular ones include PS2 Online and Bobz Entertainment. See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bbxOGm4dPxZ4Vbzyu3XxBnZmuPx3Ue-cPqBeTxtnvkQ for details.
# Any IP redirection entries for servers would've excluded one another; plus it appears that griefing was/is a very huge concern among the PS2 modding community, which I can vaguely presume is why they haven't openly revealed their DNS-server-side IP redirections.

# To remove system notifications that promote new games and sales, go to Settings → Desktop notifications, and turn off "Show News and Special Offer Notifications" and optionally "Show Free Game Notifications"
